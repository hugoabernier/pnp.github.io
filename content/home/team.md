The community team is a virtual team consisting of Microsoft employees and community members focused on helping the community make the best use of Microsoft products.

We believe that by sharing guidance, tools, solutions, and samples, we better both the community itself and the quality of solutions created by the community.

This initiative is not about any one person or group of people: it is about improving things for the greater good of the community.
